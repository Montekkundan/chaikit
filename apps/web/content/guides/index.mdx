## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

The guides here are designed to help developers understand stuff like components, animations, and more.

I will try to elaborate each steps which is sometimes left out when a component/template/page is created
using a library or framework.

### What's in the guides?

These guides are my deep dive and understanding of all components created by other people and me!
These are for me to keep track of what I have learned and to help others understand the same.


### How to use the guides?

Not all components/templates/pages will have a guide, only the ones which do not have much clarification, or
seems to be complex will have a guide.

I will try to keep the guides as simple as possible and will try to explain each step in detail.

### Contribution

If you have a better understanding of a component/template/page, feel free to contribute to the guides.
If you feel I have not explained a component/template/page and you need that to be explained, feel free to create an issue.
